# DIY Quantum
This project tries to provide tools to simulate quantum computer using JavaScript.  
It was created by me in the process of learning about quantum computing stuff, while exploring core ideas like Hilbert space (states), mixed states, density matrix, and gates.  
It's only intended to be a scratchboard of ideas, but you could in theory use it in your own project, if you're willing to put enough effort into it.
