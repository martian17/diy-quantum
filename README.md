# DIY Quantum
This project tries to provide tools to simulate quantum computer using JavaScript.  
It was created by me in the process of learning about quantum computing stuff, while exploring core ideas like Hilbert space (states), mixed states, density matrix, and gates.  
It is not intended to be usable or optimized, but you can still use it in your own project, if you put enough time into it.
